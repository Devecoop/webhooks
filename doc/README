Organization

lib/logic.coffee This is the file where all the logic is grouped (together with
the models). In here we take off the subscriptions related to a resource and fire
the callback events.


Foreman

As we deploy on heroku start getting used on make the app running with Foreman


Testing

Actually, for some unknown reasons (probably nock) the test suite raises
an error if we try to run all specs together. For this reason we must run
just one spec per time. At the moment this is acceptable as we have few
tests, but when they grow we'll have to find a solution for this problem
and also have a working continuous testing system.

$ gnode spec/app.spec.coffee

which stays for

$ foreman run node node_modules/jasmine-node/lib/jasmine-node/cli.js --autotest --coffee spec/app.spec.coffee
